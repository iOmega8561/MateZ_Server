# MateZ Server

This python application is the backend for a project named MateZ. The target of this project is the gaming community, it is supposed to be a tool to find new people to play with and form teams together. The project was born as a team learning challenge.

## Current state
Since this is a learning project, we had a limited timeframe to develop everything from scratch, starting from idea pitching and investigation. The code reflects this, everything works but it is not intended to be a stable codebase for a large scale application.
