# MateZ Server

This python (partially swift) application is the backend for a project named MateZ. The target of this project is the gaming community, it is supposed to be a tool to find new people to play with and form teams together. The project was born as a team learning challenge.

## Current state
Since this is a learning project, we had a limited timeframe to develop everything from scratch, starting from idea pitching and investigation. The code reflects this, everything works but it is not intended to be a stable codebase for a large scale application. It will probably never be completed but this code will still be available as a showcase.

## Features
1) User authentication
2) Session tokens
3) Data encryption
4) MySQL integration
5) Image download
6) Insert/Delete Gaming lobbies (request objects)
7) User avatar
8) User favourite games
9) Global chatting

## Credits
The "Couch Potatoes" team is behind this idea, thanks to my colleagues for supporting me during this journey with their awesome attitude and thanks specifically to Aryan Garg for his contribution that made chatting possible.
